<?php namespace Nord\ElasticsearchBundle\Search\Sort;

/**
 * Allows to add one or more sort on specific fields. Each sort can be reversed as well. The sort is defined on a per
 * field level, with special field name for _score to sort by score, and _doc to sort by index order.
 *
 * The order defaults to desc when sorting on the _score, and defaults to asc when sorting on anything else.
 *
 * _doc has no real use-case besides being the most efficient sort order. So if you donâ€™t care about the order in which
 * documents are returned, then you should sort by _doc. This especially helps when scrolling.
 *
 * @see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-sort.html
